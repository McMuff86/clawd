# Pose Library – Biomechanical Pose Descriptions

> **Purpose:** Provide detailed, anatomically-aware pose prompts for AI image generation.  
> Each pose replaces vague action words ("character runs") with specific biomechanical descriptions  
> that produce dynamic, realistic, and varied poses in generated panels.

## Usage Notes

1. **Combine with shot type:** A "running" pose in a close-up focuses on facial strain and arm motion; in a wide shot, full body mechanics are visible
2. **Layer with emotion:** "Running + scared" → add wide eyes, looking back over shoulder
3. **Environment interaction:** Poses should connect to the scene — running ON a surface, leaning AGAINST a wall, gripping A railing
4. **Gender/build variations:** The base poses are universal; AI will adapt proportions to the character description
5. **Avoid static defaults:** If no pose matches, still use "natural dynamic pose, body in motion, weight distribution visible" rather than nothing
